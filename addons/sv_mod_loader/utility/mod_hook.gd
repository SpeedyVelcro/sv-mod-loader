## Mod Hook
##
## This is a blank example of a mod hook. Code in the _init() method will
## be called when the mod is loaded, provided that this file is placed at the
## root of your mod project (i.e. "res://mod_hook.gd")


# Override of Godot Object lifecycle hook
func _init() -> void:
	pass # Replace with code you want to execute when your mod is loaded
