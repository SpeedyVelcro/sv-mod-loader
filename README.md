# SV Mod Loader
SV Mod Loader is an interface that can be used in games made with Godot 4.X to
allow users to load user-made mods. It is currently a work-in-progress.

To allow pop-up dialogs to show up deteched from the main window (instead of as
an embedded window), disable
[embed subwindows](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_projectsettings.html#class-projectsettings-property-display-window-subwindows-embed-subwindows)
in your project settings.
